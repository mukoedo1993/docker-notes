Use case 2 : 

  Deploy a nginx http server
  Override the configuration in it.
  copy my static html pages written in html 5 bootstrap

Real world use case:

Developer has to download nginx http server, make the changes and bank the configuration changes in to the http server and the biggest disadvantage 
of this approach is that there is a possibility that the httpd server may not work or a particular OS when it is promoted to higher environments
such as QA and files may be missed out or the configuration may have to be changed which is error prone.

So learn how to create an image, run a container and then push the image to the repository
